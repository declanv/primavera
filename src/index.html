    <h1>
      If ever there were a spring day so perfect,
      so uplifted by a warm intermittent breeze

      that it made you want to throw
      open all the windows in the house

      and unlatch the door to the canary's cage,
      indeed, rip the little door from its jamb,

      a day when the cool brick paths
      and the garden bursting with peonies

      seemed so etched in sunlight
      that you felt like taking

      a hammer to the glass paperweight
      on the living room end table,

      releasing the inhabitants
      from their snow-covered cottage

      so they could walk out,
      holding hands and squinting

      into this larger dome of blue and white,
      well, today is just that kind of day.
