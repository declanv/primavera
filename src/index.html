            If ever there were a spring day so perfect,
            so uplifted by a warm intermittent breeze
          </h1>
          <h1>
            that it made you want to throw
            open all the windows in the house
          </h1>
          <h1>
            and unlatch the door to the canary's cage,
            indeed, rip the little door from its jamb,
          </h1>
          <h1>
            a day when the cool brick paths
            and the garden bursting with peonies
          </h1>
          <h1>
            seemed so etched in sunlight
            that you felt like taking
          </h1>
          <h1>
            a hammer to the glass paperweight
            on the living room end table,
          </h1>
          <h1>
            releasing the inhabitants
            from their snow-covered cottage
          </h1>
          <h1>
            so they could walk out,
            holding hands and squinting
          </h1>
          <h1>
            into this larger dome of blue and white,
            well, today is just that kind of day.
          </h1>
